# Research Questions
---
name:questions

&nbsp;

- Measuring legislator behaviours and tendencies towards constituencies under different electoral systems is important.

- This paper quantitatively investigates this topic using the case of Taiwan Legislative Yuan and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from _multi-member districts (MMD)_ to _single-member districts (SMD)_. 

- Research Questions:

 1. Are the legislators in insingle non-transferable vote system (SNTV) more likely to ask more about .hi-grey[the provision of particularistic goods] in the parliamentary questions?

 2. Dose the reform change legislators' electoral strategies and behaviours?

# Implication of PQs
---
name:questions

&nbsp;

- Legislaive activities such as .hi-grey[legislative votings],  .hi-grey[debates] (**e.g, Parspeech V2**) and .hi-grey[parliamentary questions] play a significant role in most democracies. 

- The advantages for focusing on parliamentary questions:


 1. The party leadership have less control over MP's motivation to employ parliamentary questions (Judge 1974, Shane 2011).


 2. Parliamentary questions may reveal MPs' interests in policy preference (Shane 2011).
 
 
---


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- MPs ask questions for several reasons.

  1. Because of their .hi-grey[expertise] or domain responsibility of delegation for question topics.

  2. personal preference such as their nature of .hi-grey[substantive representation] (Russo 2021; Saalfeld 2011; Martin 2011)
  
  3. electoral motivation: .hi-grey[personal reputation] (Martin 2011)

  4. electoral rule and systems.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- In this paper, I introduce the case of .hi-grey[Taiwan Legislative Yuan], where the electoral system reformed through SNTV to SMD, to evaluate how electoral motives shape legislators' tendency to pork-barrel projects under different electoral systems. 


- In particular, parliamentary questions are the primary channel for legislators to .hi-grey[scrutinize the government] and .hi-grey[express political intentions]. 


- These parliamentary questions allow identification of different .hi-grey[question topics], .hi-grey[categories] and .hi-grey[further information] regarding .hi-grey[legislators' opinions of policy interests] and agenda at the individual level.

# Background & Literature
---
name:questions

&nbsp;


- The SNTV-MMD was the major system to elect legislators before 2008 in Taiwan. 

- This was thought to intensify majority-seeking parties to run more than one candidate in a district, which increases incentives for candidates to run on personal votes against their party reputation (Cox 1990; Carey and Shugart 1995).

- The SNTV in Taiwan was criticized for creating .hi-grey[excessive intra-party chaos and competition] (Cox 1990; Hirano 2006; Ames 2001), as well as .hi-grey[encouraging factional and candidate-centered electoral politics] (e.g. Batto and Huang 2016; Wu 2003). 


---

&nbsp;

- Under SNTV, co-partisan candidates cannot rely exclusively on their party reputation and have to find an alternative means of attracting votes by .hi-grey[running on a personal reputation] via .hi-grey[providing paricularistic services] (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987; Reed 1994; Carey and Shugart 1995).

- Catalinac (2016) finds that LDP (Liberal Democratic Party) candidates under the SMDs in Japan adopted new electoral strategies by mentioning programmatic policies such as national security.

- Hypothesis:

  __1. Under SNTV-MMD, legislators are more likely to propose the questions regarding the provision of particularistic goods.__

  __1. Under SMD-MMM, legislators are more like to ask the questions related to programmatic and regulatory policies__

# Parliarmentary Questions

name:parliamentary-questions  

- In order to analyze parliamentary questions, I have webscraped the parliamentary questions from the official website of Taiwan Legislative Yuan from 1993 to 2020, including the relevant information about _the classified topics_, _selected keywords_ and the corresponding _question type_.

### Training Deep Learning Model


- Existing labelled pork legislation


- Train a machine to identify pork-barrel features from parliamentary questions over time. 

```{r echo = F, out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/diagram.png")
```

### Regression


- Regression analyses are employed to answer the research questions.

# Training Data
---


### Training Data: Pork-barrel Legislation


- The gold standard for identifying the pork-barrel legislation is based on the target beneficiaries of the policy (distributed vs concentrated)  and attributes of policy cost (distributed vs concentrated).

- Typical pork-barrel policies (or legislation) mainly incur distributed costs while generating parochial benefits for __specific regions__ or __designated population groups__.

```{r echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/porktype.png")
```

### An Example of Pork Barrel Legislation

&nbsp;


```{r echo = F, out.width = "55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/billeg.png")
```

---

### Number of Train/ Test Splits


- The collection of this data set consists of 7243 pieces of legislation which were annotated as Pork (with label 1) or Non-Pork (with label 0).

```{r echo = F, out.width = "55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/full_plot.png")
```

- This dataset was cross-coded by three researchers to perform its validity, which achieves 98% in terms of consistency and preciseness among coders.

# Takeaway
---

&nbsp;


- Evidence exists to show that legislators under SNTV are more likely to ask pork-barrel projects in the questions. 


- The reform  demonstrates heterogeneous effects on major parties vis-à-vis the minority parties  


- The Limitation:

  1. the pork barrel legislation from training data used in this paper has been nearly ten years. The deep learning classifier might fail to capture unknown concepts developed in the post-reform period. 

  2. a steady decrease in the total number of questions since 2003

  3. Explainable Machine Learning: in Chinese or other Non-English languages might be somewhat challenging for social science students.
