# .tiny[Why Parliarmentary Questions]
---
name:why-pq

#### Legislaive activities such as .ul.hi-grey[_legislative votings_], .ul.hi-grey[_debates_] (*e.g, ParSpeech V2*) and .ul.hi-grey[_parliamentary questions_] (*e.g, LACAN*) play a significant role in most democracies. 

--

> __Roll Calls__: Legislative votings are generally dominent by party 

> + .grey-light.it[Slapin et. al (2018): Politicians grandstand strategically against party in the British Parliament]

> + .grey-light.it[Park (2021): in US House committee Hearings]

--

> __Debates__: MPs are not equally access to floor speech

--

#### The advantages of using the PQs: 

> .ul.hi-grey[_comprehensive_], .ul.hi-grey[_accessible_], and .ul.hi-grey[_rich_] 

--

> The party leadership have less control over MP's motivation to employ parliamentary questions .grey-light.it[(Shane 2011)].

--

> Parliamentary questions may reveal MPs' interests in policy preference .grey-light[(Shane 2011; Saalfeld 2011)].
 
---

&nbsp;

#### MPs ask questions for several reasons:

> + Because of their .hi-grey[expertise] or domain responsibility of delegation for question topics.

--

> + Personal preference such as their nature of .hi-grey[substantive representation] .grey-light.it[(Russo 2021; Saalfeld 2011; Martin 2011)]


  
--
  
> + Electoral motivation: .hi-grey[personal reputation] .grey-light[(Martin 2011)]

# .tiny[Implication]
---
name:implication

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### In this paper:

> + I introduce the case of .hi-grey[__Taiwan Legislative Yuan__], where the electoral system reformed through SNTV to SMD, to evaluate how electoral motives shape legislators' tendency to pork-barrel projects under different electoral systems.

--

> + Parliamentary questions are the primary channel for legislators to .hi-grey[scrutinize the government] and .hi-grey[express political intentions]. 

--

> + These parliamentary questions allow identification of different .hi-grey[_question topics_], .hi-grey[_categories_] and further information regarding .hi-grey[_legislators' opinions of policy interests and agenda at the individual level_].

# .tiny[Background & Literature]
---
name:background

&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### Theoretical Expectation:

> + The SNTV-MMD was the major system to elect legislators before 2008 in Taiwan. 

--

> + This was thought to intensify majority-seeking parties to run more than one candidate in a district, which increases incentives for candidates to run on personal votes against their party reputation .grey-light[(Cox 1990; Carey and Shugart 1995)]. 

--

> + Under SNTV, co-partisan candidates cannot rely exclusively on their party reputation and have to find an alternative means of attracting votes by .hi-grey[running on a personal reputation] via .hi-grey[providing paricularistic services] .grey-light[(Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987; Reed 1994; Carey and Shugart 1995)].


---

&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### SNTV in Taiwan Before 2008


> + The SNTV in Taiwan was criticized for creating .hi-grey[excessive intra-party chaos and competition] .grey-light[(Cox 1990; Hirano 2006; Ames 2001)], as well as .hi-grey[encouraging factional and candidate-centered electoral politics] .grey-light[(e.g. Batto and Huang 2016; Wu 2003)]. 

--

> + Luor and Liao (2009) finds that the more pork-barrel legislation legislators propose, the higher grant allocation the municipalities (districts) receive.

--

> + Catalinac (2016) finds that LDP (Liberal Democratic Party) candidates under the SMDs in Japan adopted new electoral strategies by mentioning programmatic policies such as national security.

---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### Hypothesis:

> _Hypothese Ⅰ: Under the SNTV-MMD, legislators are more likely to propose the questions regarding the provision of particularistic goods._

> _Hypothese ⅠⅠ: Under the SMD-MMM, legislators are more like to ask the questions related to programmatic and regulatory policies_

name:research-design

&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### Training Deep Learning Model:

> Existing labelled pork legislation from 2007 to 2008


> Train a machine to identify pork-barrel features on parliamentary questions over time. 

--

#### Regression Analysis:

> Regression analyses are employed to answer the research questions.

> Control for the effects from legislators and municipalities across the years. 


---

#### Training Data (Pork-barrel Legislation):


> - The gold standard for identifying the pork-barrel legislation is based on the target beneficiaries of the policy (distributed vs concentrated)  and attributes of policy cost (distributed vs concentrated).

--

> - Typical pork-barrel policies (or legislation) mainly incur distributed costs while generating parochial benefits for .ul.hi-grey[_specific regions_] or .ul.hi-grey[_designated population groups_].

--

> - This dataset was cross-coded by three social science researchers to perform its validity, which achieves 98% in terms of consistency and preciseness among coders .grey-light[(Luor and Hsieh 2008; Luor and Liao 2009)].

#### Strength:

> dealing with .ul.hi-grey[_unseen words_], particularily in Chinese (unspaced language).

> Hate speech detection .grey-light[(Safaya, Abdullatif, and Yuret 2020)] and patent document classification .grey-light[ (Lu and Ni 2019)]

# .tiny[Takeaway]
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### Takeaway


- Evidence exists to show that legislators under SNTV are more likely to ask pork-barrel projects in the questions. 

--

- The reform  demonstrates heterogeneous effects on manistream parties vis-à-vis small parties  

--

#### The Limitation:

> __Training Data__: The pork barrel legislation from training data used in this paper has been nearly ten years. The deep learning classifier might fail to capture unknown concepts developed after the post-reform period. 

--

> __Social Media?__: A steady decrease in the total number of PQs since 2003
